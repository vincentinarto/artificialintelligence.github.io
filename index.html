      <h1>History of AI</h1>
      <div class="history">
      <p>The idea of inanimate objects coming to life as intelligent beings has been around for a long time. The ancient Greeks had myths about robots, and Chinese and Egyptian engineers built automatons. </p>
      <p>The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. </p>
      <p>MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky and others who attended the conference were extremely optimistic about AI's future. "Within a generation [...] the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved," Minsky is quoted as saying in the book "AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence" (Basic Books, 1994).</p>
      <p>But achieving an artificially intelligent being wasn't so simple. After several reports criticizing progress in AI, government funding and interest in the field dropped off – a period from 1974–80 that became known as the "AI winter." The field later revived in the 1980s when the British government started funding it again in part to compete with efforts by the Japanese. </p>
      <p>The field experienced another major winter from 1987 to 1993, coinciding with the collapse of the market for some of the early general-purpose computers, and reduced government funding. </p>
      <img src="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/files/40697/The-Brain-Intelligent-Machines-AI-timeline.jpg" alt="history" class="image2">
      <p>But research began to pick up again after that, and in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a chess champion when it defeated Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov. And in 2011, the computer giant's question-answering system Watson won the quiz show "Jeopardy!" by beating reigning champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. </p>
      <p>This year, the talking computer "chatbot" Eugene Goostman captured headlines for tricking judges into thinking he was real skin-and-blood human during a Turing test, a competition developed by British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950 as a way to assess whether a machine is intelligent. </p>
      <p>But the accomplishment has been controversial, with artificial intelligence experts saying that only a third of the judges were fooled, and pointing out that the bot was able to dodge some questions by claiming it was an adolescent who spoke English as a second language.</p>
      <p>Many experts now believe the Turing test isn't a good measure of artificial intelligence. </p>
      <p>"The vast majority of people in AI who've thought about the matter, for the most part, think it’s a very poor test, because it only looks at external behavior," Perlis told Live Science. </p>
      <p>In fact, some scientists now plan to develop an updated version of the test. But the field of AI has become much broader than just the pursuit of true, humanlike intelligence. </p>

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
       <p> Artificial intelligence has been a part of our daily lives for quite some time, and it's importance has been significantly increasing 
        over the past few years. AI has affected various fields greatly, both positively and negatively. It has helped humans increase efficiency in works that they do and have tremendous effect to the society. So what kinds of AI technology really stands out in our daily lives, and helps humans maximize their efficiency in doing daily chores?</p>

      <div class="text">Examples</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="Example">
     
     <p>1. Siri</p>
     <img src="https://applemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hey-Siri-iPad-AAPro-By-JQason-Zigrino-wallpaper.jpg" alt="siri" class="media0">
     <p>Siri is a pseudo-intelligent digital personal assistant developed by apple. Almost all apple products such as Iphone and Ipad have Siri features. Siri is the friendly voice-activated computer that users interact with on a daily basis. It helps the users to find information, gives directions, add events to the calendar, etc.
     </p>


     <p>2. Tesla</p>
     <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/2334246.jpg" alt="tesla" class="media0">
     <p>Tesla's use of data, AI and ML to build a neural network — a system of sensors, data, communications, CPUs, peripheral hardware, and software that collectively processes information and adapts and learns like a human — is where the company really shines. This is quite possibly one of the best cars ever made with its self-driving features, predictive capabilities, and absolute technological innovation.
     </p>


      <p>3. Netflix</p>
      <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1917118.jpg" alt="netflix" class="media0">
      <p>Everyone nowadays definitely knows Netflix. It is a widely popular content-on-demand service that uses predictive technology to offer recommendations on the basis of consumers’ reaction, interests, choices, and behavior. It analyzes billions of records to suggest films that you might like based on your previous reactions and choices of films. This tech is getting smarter and smarter by the year as the dataset grows. However, the tech's only drawback is that most small-labeled movies go unnoticed while big-named movies grow and balloon on the platform.
      </p>


      <p>4. Nest (Google)</p>
      <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YbXM-0Su5_5bjliHVAu5ke1RTXJrgU30U8R4PaP0tESZMtpBxfNNH9YRDXwEEkhFC54=w2880" alt="nest" class="media0">
      <p>Nest was one of the most famous and successful artificial intelligence startups and it was acquired by Google in 2014 for $3.2 billion. The Nest Learning Thermostat uses behavioral algorithms to save energy based on your behavior and schedule. It employs a very intelligent machine learning process that learns the temperature you like and programs itself in about a week. Moreover, it will automatically turn off to save energy, if nobody is at home. In fact, it is a combination of both – artificial intelligence as well as Bluetooth low-energy because some components of this solution will use BLE services and solutions.
      </p>


      <p>5. Flying drones</p>
      <img src="https://parazero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Amazon.jpg" alt="drones" class="media0">
      <p>The flying drones are already shipping products to customers home – though on a test mode. They indicate a powerful machine learning system that can translate the environment into a 3D model through sensors and video cameras. The sensors and cameras are able to notice the position of the drones in the room by attaching them to the ceiling. Trajectory generation algorithm guides the drone on how and where to move. Using a Wi-Fi system, we can control the drones and use them for specific purposes – product delivery, video-making, or news reporting.

    <h1>Social Life</h1>
    <img src="https://upminded.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/social-media-wallpaper-icon17-Tricks-If-Your-Username-Is-Taken.jpg" alt="SocialMeda" class="media">
     <p>Whenever you upload photos on Facebook, the service automatically focus on faces then suggests friends to tag. So how do Facebook identify which of your friends is in the photo? Facebook uses AI to recognize faces and then search each of the faces to their identity so that Facebook can detect each of the faces account. </p>
     <p>Facebook also uses AI to personalize your newsfeed and ensure you’re seeing posts that interest you. Particular business interest to Facebook is showing ads that are relevant to your interests. So by using this features, ads can be offered to the right person and that may be beneficial with the seller and also buyer. In other words, it means you’re more likely to click them and buy something from the advertisers—and when you do, Facebook gets paid.</p>
     <p>On the other hand, Snapchat introduced facial filters, called Lenses, in 2015. These filters track facial movements, allowing users to add animated effects or digital masks that adjust when their faces moved.</p>

     <h1>Digital/Virtual Assistants</h1>
     <img src = "D:\Business Infotmation Systems\Year 1\Semester 3\Introduction to Internet Technologies\Assignment\web photo design\Amazon-Echo.jpg" alt="Alexa" class="media">
     <p>A virtual assistant, also called AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application program that understands the human natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.</p>
     <p>Such tasks, historically performed by a personal assistant or secretary, include taking dictation, reading text or email messages aloud, looking up phone numbers, scheduling, placing phone calls and reminding the end user about appointments. Popular virtual assistants currently include Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google Assistant </p>
     <p>Virtual assistants can also be contrasted with another type of consumer-facing AI programming, called smart advisers. Smart adviser programs are subject-oriented like Apple’s Siri, while virtual assistants are task-oriented like Amazon Alexa. One of the example on how virtual assistant work is when users call out the wake word, "Alexa." A light on the device signals to the user it is ready to receive a command, which typically involves simple language requests, such as "what is the weather today," or "play pop music." Those requests are processed and stored in Amazon's cloud.</p>

         <h1>Self driving and vehicle entertainment</h1>
     <img src ="https://www.tesla.com/sites/tesla/files/curatedmedia/model-s%402x.jpg" alt="tesla" class ="media">
     <p> Tesla's features that makes autopilot possible : </p>
       <ul><li>A forward-facing radar</li>
           <li>Cameras</li>
           <li>Cameras provide visibility up to 250 meters away</li>
           <li>A high-precision digitally-controlled electric assist braking system</li>
           <li>12 long-range ultrasonic sensors around the car</li>
           <li>These sensors can be affected if there is debris covering them</li>
           <li>Sense everything within 16 feet away from the vehicle</li>
       </ul>
     <p>Tesla autosteer function let it stays centered in a lane, change lanes, and self-park. To keep the Tesla centered, the cameras around the car track the positioning of road markings and the sensors monitor other cars on the road to keep a safe distance. For the Tesla to change lanes, the driver manually indicates the turn signal, then the sensors prevent the Tesla from merging into other cars. To self-park in parallel and perpendicular positions the car uses both the sensors and cameras to avoid hitting any surroundings.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1>Entertainment Recommendations</h1>
      <img src ="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5ecec33e89ee2f0006815381/960x0.jpg?fit=scale" alt="tesla" class ="media">
        <p>AI can help us find the best entertainment (Music or Videos). Music services use AI to track your listening habits. Then, they use the information to suggest other songs you might like to hear.  For example, Spotify offers suggestions for new discoveries, new releases, and old favorites, based on your listening habits. And this also happen when you search videos in Youtube.</p>
        <p>Netflix also offers personalized movie recommendations. Its AI-powered suggestions take into account factors like movies that the user are frequently watch to offer the best movie that match the personality. For example, when a user loves to watch Korean drama, then Netflix will give the best Korean drama recommendation in the home page</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1>Web Searching</h1>
      <img src ="C:\Users\VINCENT\Downloads\mitchell-luo-jz4ca36oJ_M-unsplash.jpg" alt="google" class ="media">
        <p>Google search engines evolved over time by studying the linguistics used in searches. Its AI learns from results and adapts over time to better meet the needs of users.</p>
        <p>For example, a search of “what are neural networks and how are they related to synapses” offers Google’s choice of “best answer” highlighted at the top, followed by a list of sources that answer the question.</p>
        <p>The purpose of Google’s algorithm is to deliver the best possible results to the searcher. In order to do this, Google uses AI to try to determine the quality of content and match it to the user’s query.</p>  
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1>Aircraft Autopilot</h1>
      <img src ="https://i1.wp.com/pilotstories.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_63552.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1" alt="google" class ="media">
        <p>Nowadays, many people most likely will travel to another country or even intercity using airplane. We know that there’s a pilot that flew the plane from one place to another. However, did anyone know that not just a certified pilot flew the plane but also, an artificial intelligence take part to help pilot flew the plane.</p> 
        <p>AI autopilots in commercial airlines is a surprisingly early use of AI technology that dates as far back as 1914, depending on how loosely you define autopilot. The New York Times reports that the average flight of a Boeing plane involves only seven minutes of human-steered flight, which is typically reserved only for takeoff and landing.</p>
        <p>According to a report by Wired Magazine, Boeing is working toward building jetliners completely piloted by artificial intelligence — with no human pilots at the helm.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h1>Face Recognition</h1>
    <img src ="https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/04/2cb2b79b-f12a-4ce7-a459-c888ef1ebfe2/resize/1200x900/b88868edbece005ae6dd2c9f0b237172/facial-recog.jpg" alt="google" class ="media">
    <p>When the first face recognition technology comes out, many people thought that it can be easily tricked with the help of a video or a picture of the owner. There are several cases in which facial recognition systems can be fooled by the face of an owner’s sibling. It occurs due to inaccuracies in 2D facial recognition. Therefore, law enforcement agencies are looking for better improvement in biometric authentication as it fails at times due to the fact that criminal’s faces may not be fully visible in public places.</p>
    <p>This is where AI comes to solve this problem. Using 3D biometrics, AI successfully detect face of a person and learns from millions of images. AI also can analyze the picture of oldies when the user register their younger images. So this validates the fact that with AI and biometrics together more authentic model for face recognition can be created.</p>

      <div class="text">Possible Advancement of AI</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class=poss>
    <p>The future of AI includes the advancement of the systems that capable of doing what machine learning systems can’t do. The AI intelligently and smoothly could interact with human experts and eventually providing them with articulate explanations and answers, even at the edge of the network or in robotic devices. On the other hand, people will see and work with systems provided with rare and valuable intelligence. For example:</p>
       <h1>Transportation</h1>
          <img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/media-handler.php?mediaPath=https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2019-07/24/full/1563987763-668.jpg&width=1200" alt="transport" class="media1">
          <p>Large ships currently operate largely unmonitored, especially compared to other modes of transportation such as jets and smart cars. Imagine if supertankers as larger-than-average IoT devices, then they can be connected, tracked through networks of satellites, and coordinated efficiently by cognitive AI. State of the art AI systems can even predict shipping patterns for insight into supply and demand.</p>
       <h1>Medical</h1>
          <img src="https://www.smartdatacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/medical-AI.jpg" alt="Health" class="media1">
          <p>Currently, most medical monitoring devices are just a dynamic alarm unit. However, in the upcoming years, AI probably can take smart medical devices to a higher level by making it possible for two completely independent systems – one inside the body, the other attached to the body – by working in sync. Imagine an intelligent spinal alignment implant that could communicate with an intelligent prosthetic limb, coordinating strategies to improve a patient’s balance. This would enable them to walk confidently while increasing stamina and reducing strain, all while providing actionable data to physical therapists. This is a boundary where AI and robotics collaborate for human good.</p>
