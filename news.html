          <p class="content1">Siri, Cortana and Alexa have made friends with many young children, but do the kids know that Alexa isn’t a little person in a black speaker?</p>
          <p class="content1">Sure.</p>
          <p class="content1">But habitat may be as far as a child’s understanding of artificial intelligence goes, even though Netflix uses it to suggest what they might like to watch next.</p>

          <h2 class="name">$45.2 Billion Worldwide Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Industry to 2026</h2>
          <p class="title">Businesswire</p>
          <p class="content1">The AI in healthcare market is expected to be valued at USD 4.9 billion in 2020 and is likely to reach USD 45.2 billion by 2026; it is projected to grow at a CAGR of 44.9% during the forecast period.</p>
          <p class="content1">The major factors driving the growth of the market are the increasing volume of healthcare data and growing complexities of datasets, the intensifying need to reduce towering healthcare costs, improving computing power and declining hardware costs, a growing number of cross-industry partnerships and collaborations, and rising imbalance between health workforce and patients driving the need for improvised healthcare services.</p>

          <p class="title">ScienceDaily</p>
          <p class="content1">In groundbreaking new research, mechanical engineers and computer scientists at the University of Minnesota have developed a 3D printing technique that uses motion capture technology, similar to that used in Hollywood movies, to print electronic sensors directly on organs that are expanding and contracting. The new 3D printing technique could have future applications in diagnosing and monitoring the lungs of patients with COVID-19.</p>
          <p class="content1">The research is published in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).</p>
